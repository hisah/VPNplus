# VPN+
VPN+ is an on-device VPN, deep packet scanning, and Naive Bayes classifier implemented as an Android application.  The system uses deep packet scanning to identify personally identifiable and otherwise sensitive information being transmitted to the Internet.  The Naive Bayes classifier is a proof of concept implementation that demonstrates that the user choice of whether to "Block" or "Allow" these packets can be learned and predicted using machine learning.
